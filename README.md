#Electrcity Billing System
Assignment 1
Your team will be given the topic for a project with description, your task is to implement ONE of
the design patterns:
● Factory method
● Abstract factory
● Prototype
● Singleton

You are not required to develop the project (for example, if the project is about to create an
Android app, then it does not mean that you have to create an Android project. It means you
should just take into account the aspects of mobile development when you are creating your
classes). It is about implementing the design pattern within the context of the project. You may
choose any feature (functionality) of your project, and if you think that the description does not
contain a feature to implement the design pattern, you are free to add a feature to the project
within the context of the topic.

Your work should contain the followings:

UML class diagram - (weight 35 %)
Code - (weight 50 %)
Report - (weight 15 %)
That is you should first create an UML diagram (preferably in draw.io) for the given problem,
then you should implement the UML diagram in Java. Also write a report that describes your
code and UML, and the reason why you chose the particular pattern to implement the feature.

You have to submit a zipped folder which contains two items to moodle:

PDF document which contains UML class diagram (if the diagram is too big, then write
the url to your draw.io) and report
The source code (written in JAVA) files in zipped format.
You will get 100 if your work meets the following requirement:
● For the UML class diagram: the fields / methods are implemented logically according to
the feature (you don’t have to define a lot of fields/methods, define only those that are
necessarily obvious). And when you are defining primitive types, the types should be
consistent with:https://www.uml-diagrams.org/data-type.html
● For the UML class diagram: the relationships between classes should also be defined (if
there is an association then define it). Look at here:
https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class.html. When thereis a relationship between classes,
you should also indicate it in your class fields/methods (for example, if class A has the
instance of class B, then indicate class B as a field in the class A).

● When you implement the UML diagram in code, follow OOP principles. And your code
should be consistent with your UML diagram, say all the methods/fields in your UML
diagram should also be implemented in your code. Also, show how your classes can be
used. (For example, if you created classes for the Factory design pattern, also write a
code snippet that implements, creates objects etc).
● Try to follow the Java code conventions, so that we could judge the cleanness of your
code:https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
● Your report clearly and shortly justifies why you chose the particular pattern and
describes the job you have done in UML and your code.
● Programming language restrictions: you can only use Java in your code.



The main task of designing software is to automate something with greater efficiency. In our day-to-day lives,
one of the biggest systems that are in dire need of automation is the billing system for electricity. Till today,
bills are generated manually after readings are taken. Work done to automate reading meters and generating
bills will go a long way in ensuring work is done in the most efficient way possible while ensuring accuracy in the
numbers quoted on the bills. There are lots of additions that can be done to ensure this
project remains on top.
